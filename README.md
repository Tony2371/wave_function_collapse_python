# Python implementation of Wave Function Collapse algorithm for interiors generation

Technical stack:
- Python 3.10
- PyGame 2.5

**15.11.2023**
Initial release with Wave Function Collapse, based on tiling approach. Unfortunately, it doesnt show good results at all.
Will implement 3x3 overlapping model, which looks more promising.
